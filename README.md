This program is a Python implementation of a fractal tree drawer using the turtle module. It allows the user to input the number of recursive branch iterations and choose a color for the tree. The fractal tree is drawn on a turtle graphics window.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The program also uses the turtle module, which is a standard library in Python, so no additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Clone the repository or download the `fractal_tree.py` file.

3. Navigate to the directory where the `fractal_tree.py` file is located.

4. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell
   python fractal_tree.py
   ```

5. Enter the number of branches for the fractal tree when prompted.

6. Enter the RGB values for the color of the tree. Use 1 for a color channel that you want to include and 0 for a channel you want to exclude. For example, entering "1 0 1" will create a tree with red and blue colors but no green.

7. The turtle graphics window will open, and the fractal tree will be drawn.

8. Close the window to exit the program.

## Example

Here's an example of running the program:

```shell
Enter a Number of Branches: 5
INPUT RGB VALUES 1 or 0: 1 0 1
```

This will draw a fractal tree with 5 recursive branch iterations, using red and blue colors.
